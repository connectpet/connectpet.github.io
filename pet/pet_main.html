        <h2><b>
        Millions of animals are currently in shelters and foster homes awaiting adoption. Design an experience that will help connect people looking for a new pet with the right companion for them.

        </h2>
        <br>
            
        <p>
        My initial question was simple:<br>
        "Millions of animals? Is it even possible for institutions to take care of that many animals?"<br>
        "Maybe, with the help of foster homes and volunteers..."<br>
        "Or maybe not. Are a huge number of animals being adopted?"<br>
        "But still, the number doesn't sound sustainable at all."<br>
        "I mean, even though it is possible to take care of all those animals, being abandoned is not something that pet should experience..."<br>
        And I soon realized that I need some more information on the status quo of the shelter animals. <br>
            </p>
            <h2>
        I decided to start on the initial research on understanding the problem space - learn more about shelter animals and related discussions. </h2>
        </div>
        
        
        
        <div class = "content" id = "ir">
                

        <h1>Brief Breakdown</h1>
        <h2>
         <b>Status quo of shelter animals:</b>

        <ul class = "contents_ul">
        <li>Approximately <b>6.5 million</b> animals enter U.S. animal shelters every year. In other words, 742 animals are entering animal shelters during an hour of lunch break.</li>
        <li>In U.S every year, 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized and 3.2 million are adopted.</li>
            </ul>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Why are so many animals being sent to the shelters? Before designing the service that matches the shelter animals to the pet owners, I wanted to understand the fundamental question. If all those matched owners return animals again, there is no point in matching them, right? Unfortunately, comprehensive statistics on the reason of animal being sent to the shelter was hard to find. It is not feasible to ask everyone why s/he is sending the pet to the shelter. Also, it is not easy to guess why these animals are being sent to the shelter, a.k.a. animals have no severe health or behavior issues. I found some expert's analysis and news articles.
            </p>
            
            <h2>     
                                <b>Why are animals being sent to shelters?</b>

                <ul class = "contents_ul">

                <li>The cost of taking care of the animal becomes a burden for the pet owner.</li>
                <li>Training animals properly is overlooked and lack of training leads to behavior issues.</li>
                <li>Pet owners have difficult times finding a person to take care of the pet when they are away. Also when owners relocate, the conditions of the new place may not fit with the pet. </li>
                <li>When the pet gets old or sick, it takes more resources to keep the pet.</li>
                <li>A (new) member of the family (partner, baby, other pets) does not get along with the pet. (Allergy, preference) </li></ul></h2><br>
                <p>Reasons were not completely out of nowhere but I felt that many of the things could have been anticipated in advance. Shouldn't the owners be aware that pets would age and that would need health treatments or so? Experts did point out that <b>people are not fully aware of what they are getting into</b> when they are adopting a pet and that is quite often the cause of the animal abandonment. They emphasized that adopting a pet is a real commitment and it is a pity that initial source of the pet (shop, breeders) does not equip the pet owners with this knowledge.</p> 
            <br>
                    <h1>User Research</h1>

            
            <p>Next thing to figure out was how people currently match with their pets. Few of my coworkers recently adopted puppies. I asked how they decided to adopt a pet, what the whole process was like, and what they thought about adopting a pet from the shelter.</p>
         
<h2>
                <b>Q: What do you think about adopting animals in the shelter?</b>
                                         <ul class = "contents_ul">

                <li>"Shelter pets have a behavior issue or at least some sort habits. You do not know exactly what those are by just looking at them and it is harder to correct those behaviors."</li>
                <li>"Shelter pets often have health issues and it is hard to track down their genetic information for you don't get to see their parents."</li>
                <li>"Getting a pet from the shelter is more difficult since the shelter has a high qualification standard. It also needs more paper work and has a complicated process to go through."</li>
                <li>"It is hard to get a pure breed dog from the shelter." </li>
    </ul>
                                                         </h2>
            <p>It was really interesting to listen to what people said about the shelter animals: <b>people's perception of shelter animals contradicted experts opinions that I read online.</b> Experts said that the diversity of shelter pets is enormous and one can find a specific breed without difficulty. They also argued not all shelter pets have health issues or behavior problems. Some animal trainers even mentioned that shelter animals are already trained by the previous owners, or trained after entering the shelter, or at least easier to be trained since they know what it is like to be with human and to be trained. <b>Experts all agreed that there are many misconceptions surrounding the shelter animals and I could witness those prejudices from a quick user research.</b></p>
                        
          
            <h2>
                <b>Q: How did you get your pets?</b>
                                         <ul class = "contents_ul">

                <li>"I actually found the dog on eBay. I knew that I want a small dog but other than that, it was rather a spontaneous decision. The breeder visited my flat the day after and I fell in love with my Beagle as soon as I saw him. I know a little about Beagle now, but I don't know about the other dogs."</li>
                <li>"I knew that I wanted to get a Labrador so I searched for the right breeder. I considered visiting the shelter but I thought I might end up crying the whole day after the visit so I didn't."</li>
                <li>"My dad found a puppy and he was searching for a person to take care of the puppy. I said, me!"</li>
                                             
                                             
    </ul>
                                                         </h2>
            <p>The stories on how people get the pets and relate to the pets were very diverse. I read many adoption stories through shelter websites and blog postings but there was no single pattern that shows how people choose their pets. There is one obvious reason for this: <b>it is about love.</b> <b>Just as how people fall in love with other humans is inexplicable or at least, very complex to be defined by several patterns, it is hard to measure which channels/conditions make people fall for the pets and maintain the relationship.</b></p>
            
                        <p>Then, I wondered, <b>should I design a service similar to the online dating service?</b> Asking questions about the user, cultivating excitements and curiosity, and helping them explore as much as possible to raise the chance of finding the one? The service can never guarantee who will end up being the match, so service focuses on suggesting as many as options possible. Reviewing the competitor app, I found that I am not the only one who thought about applying the online dating-like interaction for pet adoption.</p>
            <br>
               <h1>Competitive Research</h1>
        <h2>
                        <b>Existing Pet matching/adoption services</b>

        <ul class = "contents_ul">
        <li>"PawsLikeMe" uses machine learning and quiz interaction to find the perfect dog for the user. They claim that their algorithm is 95% accurate in matching the user with the compatible pet.</li>
        <li>"BarkBuddy" or "Allpaws" makes the Tinder like swipe interaction to help users find the pet.</li>
            <li>Many other services concentrate on promoting one-click search: just typing in the zip code and clicking some check boxes to filter the result. This allows users to be able to see all available pets fast and easy.</li>
            </ul>
            </h2>
<p>The more I interact with those services however, the more uncomfortable I felt about the idea of applying the dating-like interaction to the pet adoption. Especially after reading the comments people have left on the shelter home websites and blog postings about shelter pet adoption, I realized that there is a rudimentary problem with using the dating-like interaction to the pet adoption.</p>
            
            <b>ADOPTING a pet is NOT</b>

        <ul class = "contents_ul">
            <li><b>DATING: </b> Dating is usually considered as a step before the commitment. You date someone, have good times, might not follow up and that is all fine. You have a little moral responsibility to look after the other; we all know that as grown-ups, we will eventually move on. Adoption is <b>all about commitment.</b> <b>If you stop taking care, pets can hardly survive on its own.</b> Pet adoption is a 10 or more-year commitment. <b>People should spend time to understand the weight of this commitment and swiping is too quick and simple to give people a chance to consider those.</b></li>
            <li><b>SHOPPING:</b>Isn't it weird to use the same interaction pattern for two different purposes, buying something that is refundable, replaceable, and disposable vs. making a connection with the living beings? Wouldn't it be uncomfortable for some people to enter a website whose front page is covered with thumbnail pictures of smiling dogs waiting to be adopted? Wouldn't it be cruel for some people to see the text <b>"1492" shelter animals are available near him/her? What about clicking a simple checkbox and seeing the number goes down from 1492 to 200? What happens to the rest of the 1292 shelter animals?</b> </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As I get to think deeper about the action of "adopting a pet", I got to know that pet adoption service should be differentiated from  shopping or dating services. People should <b>feel the responsibility and be well informed</b> before finding the animals and adopting them. The service should be designed to get users into a proper mindset.</p>

    <div class = "content" id = "idr">
            
        
      <p>To achieve the design goals and vision, I extracted 3 key design challenges and ideated solutions:</p>      
            
  <h1>1. Grab user's attention and raise awareness</h1><h2>
        <b>Solution: Various access points to the landing page & A dedicated landing page with curated video contents that highlights the relationship between the adopter and the animal.</b>    
        </h2>
        <p> How can users be more interested in shelter animals? How can a service help users correct their prejudices?</p><p>
        Looking back on my own experience, once I got to read a bit about the shelter animals, it was pretty easy to see correct myself and understand that not all shelter animals are sick or traumatized. If there is a dedicated landing page for this service which corrects the prejudice people have through a video or attention grabbing contents, this will set a good start of pet matching journey. Having worked in an ad-tech industry, I have read and read numerous case studies about how platform succeeded in increasing the user engagement by using the video format contents. Seeing is believing and watching is the new seeing. <b>What about telling the stories of the shelter animals and their new owners through video and use that as a milestone for the pet matching service?</b> In particular, Google has the world's largest source of online videos, YouTube. Why not embark the journey of finding the pet with the YouTube videos?
        </p>
        
       
        <br>
            <h1>2. Acquire meaningful information from users</h1><h2>
            <b>
        Solution: Categorize the questions into groups and ask each group of question in a different tone/by using varied interactions</b></h2>
        
        <p>To match users with the pets, it is critical to extract high quality information from the user. How can a service learn about the users most? What information of the users is permanent/ temporary? Do users know exactly what they prefer? Can we trust what users say?<br></p>

           To have a better idea of what information I would like to get from users, I first analyzed all the information that I would like to take from users. There were two types of information. <br><b>First group</b>, information about the objective status of the user such as where they live. This type of information is essential to check if user can afford a pet at the moment and if so, what types. Answering this question will be very straightforward unless user lies or ignores the question since it is about stating the fact and describing the situation. <b>Therefore, a straightforward questionnaire along with the rationale of why this question matters will do the work. </b>
            <br>
            <b>Second group</b>, the information about what types of pet users would like to have. From the user research, I learned that getting this preference correctly can be tricky. People may think that they prefer one over the other but <b>this may not be the actual reflection of what they truly value.</b> Especially when users are not experts, often times users are not aware of their preferences or have a wrong idea of their preferences.
            <b>I decided to ask the preference questions in two angles: one, asking directly; two, asking around. While it might be hard to remember what they like or dislike, actually seeing the possible answers, being reminded and giving the preference is easier and more accurate. For example, instead of asking users what they would like to do with the pet, I will show what users can do with the pet and make them evaluate each option.</b>

            <h1>3. Educate users and make them ready for commitments</h1><h2>
        <b>Solution: Plant multiple touch points to the relevant knowledge throughout the interaction. For example, whenever there is a chance to share a relevant knowledge on the animals or on adopting animals, provide a link so that users can click and learn. </b></h2>
        <p>How can a service teach users while also get answers from them? Users can search information by themselves if they want. Is it necessary to give an access point?<br></p>

           <b>The power of displaying information at the right time at the right place is enormous;</b>to refer to the experiences of working at the display advertising, the right targeting is the essence of the modern-day digital advertisement. The same piece of information(or advertisement) can be a garbage that gets neglected or a gold that convinces users to make actions based on when, to whom and how the information is being displayed. I will treat this pet-related knowledge and adoption information as a content to advertise and design the strategies to make this advertisement work. I would aim to detect best opportunities to deliver the knowledge and deliver it in an intriguing way.</p>

            Below is the final experience flow for the persona, Jenny, who was set up in the Design Direction phase. The three key challenges and their solutions are manifested in the following user flow.

<h2>            <b>2. Jenny visits the ConnectPet. She reads about the shelter animals and learns that what she assumed for the shelter animals are not very accurate. Although she is still not sure if she is ready to have a pet, she is moved by the stories of how people develop meaningful companionship with the shelter animals. She clicks the "Start your journey" button just to check out what options are there.</b></h2>

            <h2><b>5. At first, Jenny is a bit puzzled since she has to watch all the video clips. Soon, as she starts playing those, she almost gets addicted to the cute pet videos. She marks the videos that she can relate to the most and also in the mean time, gain a lot of information about pet's activities, trainings, and etc. After finishing marking her preference, she clicks "Discover".

            <li><b>Share feedback!</b> From design direction to the final userflow, there are many things to be validated and iterated. I would like to get the feedback on the general vision before developing designs further.</li>
        <li><b>Especially, involve Users!</b> The weak spot of this concept is that the actual target users have not been involved in the design process due to the time constraint of the design challenge. Listening to their perspectives will for sure open lots of questions and would bring many insights that will help designing the better version of this service.</li>
            <li><b>Design the Shelter-side experience as well and turn ConnectPet service into a platform like service.</b> While reading the postings from the shelters, I found out that shelters are not updating their websites quickly due to the lack of resources and services. There were many outdated postings with un-matched pictures. I see a value in developing this service into a platform and help the shelter management and as a result, help matching the pets and the adopters. </li>
            <li><b>Mobile service.</b> In this design response, only the desktop side experience is elaborated. I thought Desktop could describe a ConnectPet service better. Yet, I do think that as long as the focus is well kept, ConnectPet can be translated into the mobile service as well. It will be interesting to sum up this information-rich versatile experiences into a mobile experience.</li>

               I spent a lot of time reading various profiles of the shelter animals and people's comments. Clarifying what I found from those indirect user research, I felt confused from time to time and wondered if I am answering the brief correctly. I used some notes and sketches but mostly design iterations were done on Sketch or Photoshop.I focused on the fidelity of the beginning part of the interaction since the "hook" part and "step-by-step search journey" are the key elements in my idea. I wanted to make sure those are well elaborated.</p>
