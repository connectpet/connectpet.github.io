        <h2><b>
        Millions of animals are currently in shelters and foster homes awaiting adoption. Design an experience that will help connect people looking for a new pet with the right companion for them.

        </h2>
        <br>
            
        <p>
        My initial question was simple:<br>
        "Millions of animals? Is it even possible for institutions to take care of that many animals?"<br>
        "Maybe, with the help of foster homes and volunteers..."<br>
        "Or maybe not. Are a huge number of animals being adopted?"<br>
        "But still, the number doesn't sound sustainable at all."<br>
        "I mean, even though it is possible to take care of all those animals, being abandoned is not something that pet should experience..."<br>
        And I soon realized that I need some more information on the status quo of the shelter animals. <br>
            </p>
            <h2>
        I decided to start on the initial research on understanding the problem space - learn more about shelter animals and related discussions. </h2>
        </div>
        
        
        
        <div class = "content" id = "ir">
                

        <h1>Brief Breakdown</h1>
        <h2>
         <b>Status quo of shelter animals:</b>

        <ul class = "contents_ul">
        <li>Approximately <b>6.5 million</b> animals enter U.S. animal shelters every year. In other words, 742 animals are entering animal shelters during an hour of lunch break.</li>
        <li>In U.S every year, 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized and 3.2 million are adopted.</li>
            </ul>
            </h2>
            <p>
                <b>Why are so many animals being sent to the shelters?</b> Unlike the stats like above, comprehensive statistics on the reason of animal being sent to the shelter was hard to find. It is impossible to ask everyone why s/he is sending the pet to the shelter. Also, I guessed that reasons of letting the animals go are not evident from the animals. (a.k.a. animals have no severe health or behavior issues)  I found some analysis from expert interviews and news articles.
            </p>
            
            <h2>     
                                <b>Why are animals being sent to shelters?</b>

                <ul class = "contents_ul">

                <li>The cost of taking care of the animal becomes a burden for the pet owner.</li>
                <li>Training animals properly is overlooked and lack of training leads to behavior issues.</li>
                <li>Pet owners have difficult times finding a person to take care of the pet when they are away. Also when owners relocate, the conditions of the new place may not fit with the pet. </li>
                <li>When the pet gets old or sick, it takes more resources to keep the pet.</li>
                <li>A (new) member of the family (partner, baby, other pets) does not get along with the pet. (Allergy, preference) </li></ul></h2><br>
                <p>Reasons were not completely out of nowhere but I felt that many of the things could have been anticipated in advance. Shouldn't the owners be aware that pets would age and that would be accompanied by some health treatments or so? Experts did point out that <b>people are not fully aware of what they are getting into</b> when they are adopting a pet and that is quite often the case of the animal abandonment. They emphasized that adopting a pet is a real commitment and it is a pity that initial source of the pet (shop, breeders) does not equip the pet owners with this knowledge.</p> 
            <br>
                    <h1>User Research</h1>

            
            <p>Next thing to figure out was how people currently match with their pets. I have a few coworkers who recently adopted puppies. I knew that they all got it from breeders. I asked how they decided to adopt a pet, what the whole process was like, and what they thought about adopting a pet from the shelter.</p>
         
<h2>
                <b>Q: What do you think about shelter adoption?</b>
                                         <ul class = "contents_ul">

                <li>"Shelter pets have a behavior issue or at least some sort of acquired habits. You do not know exactly what those are and it is harder to correct those behaviors."</li>
                <li>"Shelter pets often have health issues and it is hard to track down their genetic information for you don't get to see their parents."</li>
                <li>"Getting a pet from the shelter is more difficult since the shelter has a high qualification standard. It also needs more paper work and a complicated process to go through."</li>
                <li>"It is hard to get a pure breed dog from the shelter." </li>
    </ul>
                                                         </h2>
            <p>It was really interesting to listen to what people said on the shelter animals: <b>people's perception of shelter animals contradicted experts opinions that I read online.</b> Experts said that the diversity of shelter pets is enormous and one can find a specific breed without difficulty. They also argued not all shelter pets have health issues or behavior problems. Some animal trainers even mentioned that quite a lot of shelter animals are already trained (after entering the shelter) or relatively easier to be trained since they know what it is like to be with human and to be trained. <b>Experts all agreed that there are many misconceptions surrounding the shelter animals and I have witnessed those prejudices from my quick user research.</b></p>
                        
          
            <h2>
                <b>Q: How did you get your pets?</b>
                                         <ul class = "contents_ul">

                <li>"I actually found the dog on eBay. I knew that I want a small dog but other than that, it was rather a spontaneous decision. The breeder visited my flat the day after and I fell in love with my Beagle as soon as I saw him. I know a little about Beagle now, but I don't know about the other dogs."</li>
                <li>"I knew that I wanted to get a Labrador so I searched for the right breeder. I considered visiting the shelter but I thought I might end up crying the whole day after the visit so I didn't."</li>
                <li>"My dad found a puppy and he was searching for a person to take care of the dog. I said, me!"</li>
                                             
                                             
    </ul>
                                                         </h2>
            <p>The stories on how people get the pets and relate to the pets were very diverse. I kept on reading the online blog postings as well to see what conditions people generally check and what make them decide on the certain pet in the end. Yet, it was quite difficult to find One pattern and I soon realized that there is one obvious reason for this: <b>it is about love.</b> <b>Just like how people fall in love with other humans is inexplicable or at least, very complex to be defined by several patterns, it is hard to measure which channels/conditions bring out the best match between the adopter and the pet.</b> Yes, there are common denominators that usually result in a successful or unsuccessful match but, just as a relationship in the humans, well-developed love sometimes overcome all the hardship and make the relationship last.</p>
            
                        <p>Then, I wondered, <b>should I design a service similar to the dating service?</b> Asking questions about the user, cultivating excitements and curiosity, and helping them explore as much as possible? You never know exactly who will end up being the match, so you can focus on suggesting as many as options possible first. Reviewing the competitor app, I found that I am not the only one who thought of that.</p>
            <br>
               <h1>Competitive Research</h1>
        <h2>
                        <b>Existing Pet matching services</b>

        <ul class = "contents_ul">
        <li>"PawsLikeMe" uses machine learning and quiz interaction to find the perfect dog for the user. They claim that their algorithm is 95% accurate in matching the pet with the compatible owner.</li>
        <li>"BarkBuddy" or "Allpaws" makes the Tinder like swipe interaction to help find the pet.</li>
            <li>Many other services focus on finding nearby pets by one click (just typing in the zip code and clicking some check boxes to filter)</li>
            </ul>
            </h2>
<p>The more I interact with those services however, the more uncomfortable I felt about the idea of applying the dating-like experiences to the pet adoption. Especially after reading the reviews at the shelter homes, articles, and blog postings about shelter pet adoption, I realized that there is a fundamental problem with using the dating-like interaction to the pet adoption.</p>
            
            <b>ADOPTING a pet is NOT</b>

        <ul class = "contents_ul">
            <li><b>DATING: </b> Dating basically is everything but commitment. You date someone, have good times, might not follow up and that is all fine. You have no moral responsibility to look after the other; the other party may suffer, just as you suffer, but we all know that as grown-ups, we will eventually move on. Adoption is <b>all about commitment.</b> <b>If you stop caring, pets can hardly survive on its own.</b> Pet adoption is a 10 or more-year commitment. <b>People should take time to understand each other and digest what will happen with enough time and information. </b></li>
            <li><b>SHOPPING:</b> It seems very obvious that the pets are lives and not products. Isn't it weird to use the same design pattern/ interaction for those two different purposes? Buying something that is refundable, replaceable, and disposable vs. making a connection with the living organism? Wouldn't it be uncomfortable for some people to simply enter a website whose front page is filled with thumbnail pictures of smiling animals? Wouldn't it be cruel for some people to see the text <b>"1492" shelter animals are available near him/her? What about clicking a simple checkbox and seeing the number goes down from 1492 to 200? What happens to the rest of the 1292 shelter animals?</b> </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As I get to think deeper about the action of "adopting a pet", I realized that pet adoption service should pose a very different mindset to the users compared to shopping or dating. People should <b>feel the responsibilty and be well informed</b> before finding the matching animals and adopting them. The service should be designed to serve that purpose.</p>

    <div class = "content" id = "idr">
            
        
      <p>To achieve the design goals and vision, I extracted 3 main design challenges and came up with the answer:</p>      
            
  <h1>1. Grab user's attention</h1><h2>
        <b>Answer: A dedicated landing page for debunking the myths of shelter animals & various access points to the landing page</b>    
        </h2>
        <p> How can users be more interested in shelter animals? How can a service help users correct their prejudices?</p><p>
        Looking back on my own experience, once I get to read a bit about the shelter animals, it was pretty easy to see the fact that not all shelter animals are sick or traumatized. Simply math (just seeing the number of shelter animals) can tell that it is unlikely to have all those shelter animals are damaged psychologically or physically. </p>
        <p> If there is a dedicated landing page for this service which corrects the prejudice people have through a video or attention grabbing contents, this will set a good start of pet matching journey. Working in an ad-tech industry for past two years, I have read and read numerous case studies about how platform succeeded in raising the user engagement by using the video format contents. Seeing is believing and watching is the new seeing. <b>What about telling the stories of the shelter animals and their new owners through video and use that as an appetizer for the pet matching service?</b> In particular, Google has the world's largest source of all those videos YouTube. Why not embark the service with the YouTube videos?
        </p>
        
       
        <br>
            <h1>2. Acquire meaningful information from users</h1><h2>
            <b>
        Answer: Categorize the questions into groups and ask each group of question in a different tone/interaction</b></h2>
        
        <p>The best strategy to match users with the pets is to have a lot of information. How can a service learn about the users most? What information of the users will be permanent/ temporary? Do users know exactly what they prefer? Can we trust what users say?<br></p>
       <p> Tinder-type interaction could have been the low-hanging answer for this challenge. However, in the design direction, I have already decided to balance the fun with the ethical/moral responsibility. <b>What is a good way of asking a bunch of questions without getting them tired?</b></p>
        <p>
           To have a better idea of what I would like to know from users, I first divided the information that I would like to get. Indeed, the type of information that I need users to provide varied:<br><b>First group</b>, information about what users can DO to the pet. This type of information is needed to check if user can afford a pet at this point and if so, what types. An answer to this question will be rather objective and fact-based for it is literally about describing what kinds of circumstances that users have at this moment. <b>Therefore, a straight-forward questionnaire will work well. </b>
            <br>
            <b>Second group</b>, the information about what types of pet users would like to have. From the user research, I learned that getting this preference correctly is a bit trickier.People may think that they prefer one over the other but <b>this may not be the actual reflection of what they truly value.</b> Especially when users are not an expert, often times users may not be aware of one's preference or have a wrong idea of one's preference.
            <b>I decided to ask the preference questions in two angles: one, asking directly and most efficiently; two, asking around what users connect better after show & telling the available options</b>

            <h1>3. Educate users and make them ready for commitments</h1><h2>
        <b>Answer: Plant multiple touch points to the relevant knowledge throughout the interaction. For example, while asking the user-profile question, tell users why this question matters and how it is connected to finding a good match.</b></h2>
        <p>How can a service teach users while also get answers from them? Is it possible to provide users with information while asking them to provide answers?<br></p>
       <p>
           <b>The power of displaying information at the right time at the right place is enormous;</b> it influences people to be engaged and to make the desired action. To refer to the experiences of working at the display advertising, the right targeting is the essence of the modern-day digital advertisement. The same piece of information(or advertisement) can be a garbage or a gold based on when, to whom and how the information is being displayed. If I consider treating this pet-related knowledge and adoption information as a content to advertise, the most efficient way is to focus on targeting. I would aim to create the best opportunities to deliver the knowledge and deliver it well.</p>

            Below is the final experience flow for the persona, Jenny that was set up in the Design Direction phase. The three key challenges and their solutions are manifested in the following user flow.

Although she is still not sure if she is ready to have a pet, she is moved by the stories of how people develop meaningful companionship with the shelter animals. She clicks the "Start your journey"button just to check out what options are there.</b></h2><a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9hruQPHl1GzM0YyM1NZMWR6XzA/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">

She also learns that in her current living situation, there are some animals that she can have a quality time with. After answering 3 simple questions, she moves on.</b></h2>

She marks the videos that she can relate to the most and also in the mean time, gain a lot of information about pet's activities, trainings, and etc. After finishing marking her preference, she clicks "Discover". She is curious what will come next but at the same time, she wants to meet the acutal animal.</b></h2><a href = "/mockup/u5.png" target="_blank">

She does not meet those requirements for she has no green space but she decides to ask a question at least. If not, she thinks that she can find some other ways to get involved such as volunteering as well.</b></h2><a href = "/mockup/u8.png" target="_blank">

            <li><b>Share feedback!</b> From design direction to the final userflow, there are many things to be validated and iterated. I would first like to get the feedback on the general vision before developing further mock-ups.</li>
        <li><b>Especially, involve Users!</b> The weak spot of this concept is that the actual target users have not been involved in the design process due to the time constraint of the design challenge. Listening to their perspectives will for sure open lots of questions and would bring many insights that will help designing the better version of this service.</li>
            <li><b>Design the Shelter's side experience in parallel.</b>While reading the reviews from the shelter, I found an answer from the shelter that they are not updating their websites quickly enough due to the lack of resources and services. I also found lots of outdated postings with un-matched pictures. While querying the existing data can build a huge DB, I do see the value in developing this service into a platform and help the shelters managing their animals more efficiently. </li>
                    <li><b>Mobile platform. ConnectPet can be experienced both in desktop and mobile. In this design response, only the desktop side experience is elaborated for it is a better to show various "learning" touch points. It will be interesting to translate this information rich experience into mobile, while keeping the core purpose and the tone but making it simpler. </li>

        <li><b>Design Direction(1h)</b> took more time than I expected. Clearing what I found from the research was quite different from the existing search-formats in that it does not provide the quickest answers. I was debating with myself if this is a deserved sacrifice. </li>

The idea of videos came out easily for I was focusing on story-telling from the beginning. Dividing information to ask in several steps and iterating on the details of the asking action took the most time.</li>
